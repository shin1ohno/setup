# Adversarial Plan Review

Load when a plan involves any security-sensitive component. Launch an adversarial review sub-agent BEFORE implementation — required, not optional.

## Triggers

- OAuth / OIDC flows (DCR, consent, token issuance / validation, JWKS)
- JWT validation, audience / issuer / scope checks
- Secret mounts (tokens.json, ssh keys, TLS certs) with bind-mount path / UID semantics
- nginx `auth_request` or other reverse-proxy access gates
- Privilege boundaries between cooperating services (auth-proxy → MCP server, edge agent → home server)
- ALLOWED_EMAILS / IP allow-lists / firewall rules

Detail (prompt template / Live Token Round-Trip Gate / origins): see `~/.claude/docs/adversarial-review-detail.md`.
