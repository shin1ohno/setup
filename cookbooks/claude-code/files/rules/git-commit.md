# Git Commit Format

## First Line (Summary)

- Start with `{component}: ` prefix when possible (shortened filename or directory)
- Prefer contextful verbs over generic "Change", "Add", "Fix", "Update"
- Explain the "why", not just the "what"

## Default to PR Branch; Do Not Push to main

When a commit needs to reach remote `main`, default to:

1. `git checkout -b <descriptive-branch>` from latest `origin/main`
2. Commit on the branch
3. `git push -u origin <branch>`
4. `gh pr create --base main` with a summary + test plan

Do **NOT** default to `git push origin main`. The harness blocks direct pushes to `main` (correct policy), and attempting it wastes a turn on a permission denial. Even without the gate, PR flow provides a review trail for future readers and lets CI run against the isolated branch before affecting main.

**Exceptions** where direct `git push origin main` is acceptable only with explicit user opt-in:

- User has already said "push directly to main" in the current conversation
- Single-developer repo with no CI and the user has said "skip PR for this one"

Absent an explicit opt-in, always go PR branch → `gh pr create`. If a commit was just made on a local `main` tracking branch, redirect before pushing: `git branch -m <branch>; git push -u origin <branch>; gh pr create`.

## GPG Signing Failures

If `git commit` fails with a GPG signing error or timeout, present the user with `! gpg-connect-agent reloadagent /bye` to reload the GPG agent and cache the passphrase. Do not bypass signing with `-c commit.gpgsign=false` unless the user explicitly requests it.
